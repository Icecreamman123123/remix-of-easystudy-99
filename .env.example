# Lovable AI Gateway API Key (add to Supabase Edge Functions secrets)
# Get API key from your Lovable account settings
LOVABLE_API_KEY=your_lovable_api_key_here

# Note: Keep these values secret and never commit .env file to version control
# Use this file as a template for setting up environment variables in your hosting platform

# Additional notes for hosting on Lovable:
# - If you host or deploy via Lovable (lovable.dev), add the same keys in the
#   project settings/environment variables section for that Lovable project.
# - Always prefix client-exposed variables with `VITE_` so Vite injects them into
#   the build. Any non-`VITE_` keys should be reserved for server/edge functions
#   (e.g., SERVICE_ROLE keys, email provider API keys) and must NOT be exposed
#   to the frontend.

# Optional server-only secrets (DO NOT expose in client build):
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key_here
# RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key_here
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
